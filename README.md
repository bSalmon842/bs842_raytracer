## Overview

A Basic C/C++ Raytracer that outputs Raytraced Spheres to an 800x600 PPM file. Uses Lambert Diffusion.
This is an old exercise using online tutorials, I am currently in the process of fully rebuilding to incorporate more primitives and more modern standards.


## Production

Made in 1 Weekend as an exercise in learning about Raytracing, a previously foreign concept to myself.

## Current State

Currently the raytracer is operated through command line; eg "raytracer.exe [image_name].ppm". The Raytracer is also only capable of rendering Spheres with basic light, materials and reflections.
